## FAQ

* Do I need to setup webpack/babel on my workspace to have it working?

No. You can have an empty dir. Create your react component and use ctrl+shift+p to 
open the live preview.

* I need to inspect the dom. How can I do that?

You open the webview inspector. Open Keyboard Shortcuts and edit keybindings.json. Add the following:

```json
{ "key": "ctrl+shift+alt+b",  "command": "_webview.openDevTools"}     
```

Change the key as required. This should enable you to inspect the html.

* I want to have Live Playground launch a non react component. How can I do that?

React Playground will inspect any React Element but it will also evaluate an export that
starts with __Playground. So you can have the following be automatically evaluated
in React Playground

```javascript

export const __PlaygroundTestWithSomeStuff = () => {

    return (
        <SomeComponent attribute='someattr'>
            <AnotherComponent />
        </SomeComponent>
    );

}
```

You should be able to see this within the playground.
